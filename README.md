Clickstream Analytics Pipeline Using Apache Spark & Delta Lake

This repository presents a comprehensive end-to-end big data analytics pipeline built to process, optimize, and analyze large-scale clickstream data generated from a real-world e-commerce platform. The project integrates Apache Spark and Delta Lake to establish a scalable, reliable environment capable of supporting both batch and near-real-time analytical workloads. By following the Medallion Architecture, the pipeline moves data from raw ingestion through structured Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, ensuring consistency, performance, and analytics readiness at every stage.

The core of the project focuses on addressing the challenges commonly encountered in large-scale distributed processing. It includes a detailed study of essential Spark optimizations such as the use of temporary SQL views to avoid redundant I/O, broadcast joins to eliminate expensive shuffles, repartitioning based on user identifiers to efficiently compute session-level metrics, salting to mitigate severe data skew, and predicate pushdown techniques to reduce the volume of data read from storage. Each optimization is accompanied by a technical explanation, the reasoning behind the chosen approach, its implementation strategy, and a clear quantification of performance improvement. These enhancements demonstrate how engineering decisions directly influence analytical speed, cluster cost, and overall system scalability.

Beyond performance engineering, the project also implements strong data governance principles using Delta Lake’s ACID transaction guarantees, schema enforcement, and version-controlled time travel capabilities. These features ensure that data remains consistent, trustworthy, and recoverable throughout all stages of processing. The repository also includes detailed data quality evaluations covering raw data characteristics, cleaning processes, and the resulting analytical integrity. Additional sections examine cost-efficiency benefits, scalability considerations for handling ten times the current dataset size, and recommended enhancements for data security and masking to protect sensitive information.

The analytical output of the pipeline is presented through a multi-page interactive dashboard designed to communicate insights clearly and intuitively. The dashboard guides viewers from high-level platform metrics to granular product, user, and temporal analyses. It provides insights such as overall conversion funnel performance, revenue concentration patterns, user segmentation behavior, hourly and daily activity trends, and the business impact of the technical optimizations implemented. Each visualization follows a structured data storytelling methodology that makes the entire dashboard self-explanatory and actionable for business stakeholders.

The repository is organized to support full reproducibility. It includes the original project report, ETL and optimization notebooks, relevant scripts, and dashboard exports. Users can follow the included pipeline to replicate the ingestion process, transformations, optimizations, and analytical outputs. This structure makes the repository suitable for academic demonstration, professional portfolio use, or as a foundation for further development in large-scale data engineering projects.

This project was developed by Amr Ahmed, Marwan Ahmed, and Mohamed Ahmed as part of the Big Data Analytics (CIE 427) course within the Communications and Information Engineering Program at Zewail City of Science, Technology and Innovation during Fall 2025.
